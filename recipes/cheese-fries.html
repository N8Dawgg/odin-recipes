    <ol>
        <li>Shred the block of cheese, making at least a 1/4 cup of shredded cheese.
            Do not use shredded cheese from a bag as that cheese is coated in a material
            that prevents it from melting.
        </li>
        <li>Chop the green onion until you have an appropriate amount for a garnish.</li>
        <li>Cook the bacon on the stove until it is slightly under cooked.</li>
        <li>Chop the bacon into bits.</li>
        <li>Begin cooking the fries as directed, either in an oven or in an air frier.</li>
        <li>3-5 minutes before the fries are finished, quickly pull them out and throw the other ingredients on top.</li>
        <li>Finish cooking the fries as directed and you're good to go. Don't forget to let it cool off!</li>
